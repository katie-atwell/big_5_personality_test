    "This dataset was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/big-five-personality-test). It contains 1,015,342 questionnaire answers collected online by [Open Psychometrics](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/). The questionnaire used 50 items to measure five personality traits; openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Participants were asked to respond to each item (e.g. \"I am always prepared) on a scale of 1-5 (1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, and 5=Agree). "

    "By following the link to the [IPIP website](https://ipip.ori.org/newBigFive5broadKey.htm) provided in the codebook.txt file, we can see that some of the questions are negatively keyed. For example, item EXT2 in the online questionnaire results is \"I don't talk a lot\" - as this is a measure of extraversion, we would expect someone high in extraversion to disagree with this statement and provide a low score on the scale of 1-5 (1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, and 5=Agree). If this is compared to item EXT1 (\"I am the life of the party\"), we would expect someone high in extraversion to agree with this statement and provide a high score on the scale of 1-5. As a result, some of the scores in the dataset need to be reversed so that the scores consistently indicate each personality trait (e.g. high scores on the EXT items indicate a tendency towards being high in extraversion)."
